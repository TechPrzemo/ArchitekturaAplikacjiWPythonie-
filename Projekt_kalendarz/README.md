## General info
The main goal of this project was to try out Django technologies. Creating simple applications like this calendar allowed me to understand how web applications are built. 
I gained additional experience in backend development (Python) and basic skills in frontend development (HTML/JS).

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.11.9 
* Web framework - Django 5.1

## Setup
**I recommend using virtual environment (venv) to avoid colission with other libraries**.

To run this project you need to install necessary software. 
You could do this from requirements.txt file by executing the following commands:

$  cd ../Projekt_kalendarz/my_django_calendar

$  pip3 install -r requirements.txt

If you want to see the current temperature in your hometown using the OpenWeather API, you need to paste your API key into the views.py file, assigning it to the API_KEY variable in the weather_info function. Next, you need to change the value of the city variable to your hometown's name in the calendar_main function.
